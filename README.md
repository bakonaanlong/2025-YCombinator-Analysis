# 2025-YCombinator-Analysis

        THIS ENTIRE PROJECT WAS CARRIED OUT WITH SNOWFLAKE

This is a documented Analysis of 2025 YC compoanies. This markdown will contain the entire process from   the data collection-Cleaning/EDA-Visualization.

The first step was obtaining the datasets from kaggle ('yc_companies.csv' in the repo). Since i wanted to only analyze 2025 companies, i had to remove all other years companies.  

I then proceeded to Data Cleaning. It wasn't so smooth since I'm still getting used to snowflake and its subtle differences from MySQL, but i made it happen. Find below the scripts for the entire cleaning process

Script 1 - https://app.snowflake.com/eu-central-2.aws/op54975/wgm8fhCyUFK
Script 2 - https://app.snowflake.com/eu-central-2.aws/op54975/w1Ypd5wNFZx

I still have to visualize the data to tell a story, but my progress is worth a voice. See you in 24 hours for insights and visuals. SEMPER FI
